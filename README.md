# UNC Class info scraper

##What does this do?
I wrote this as part of a broader project that I'm working on. (Hopefully coming soon)

Essentially what this does is scrape the subject and class info off of the UNC course catalog website (https://catalog.unc.edu/courses/) and generates two csv files: one with all of the subjects and their abbreviations (e.g. "Aerospace Studies (AERO)") and one with all of the classes and some of the info that I scraped for my project.

##Does this work perfectly?
It might, but in reality there are probably some issues with the program. For one, there are some oddities in the UNC course catalog that could cause problems with the info. Also, I haven't manually checked every class to verify that the info is right and I have yet to come up with an efficient way to test that it is. If you notice any problems in either the info, please let me know in the issues section on GitHub.

##How can I use this?
Use it however you want. Just know that I can't make any strong claims about the accuracy or reliability of the info.

##What can I do with other questions?
Just put an issue on the repository and I'll find a way to get in contact with you.
